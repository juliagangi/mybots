# 396 Assignment 6

## The code

My snake grows along the x-axis, at fixed z- and y-coordinates. The number of snakes and links per snake are randomly generated when the program is run. Each time a link is added, with the exception of the last one, a joint is added that will connect it to the next link. A random integer selector decides whether or not to place a sensor neuron in the current link.
