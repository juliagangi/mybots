# 396 Assignment 7

## The code

My creature grows up along the z-axis, then out in the -x, +x, -y, and +y directions. Each of the 4 "arms" contains the same number of links, which are jointed at the base of each. A random integer selector decides whether or not to place a sensor neuron in the current link.
